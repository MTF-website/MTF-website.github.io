description: "Visual sensory substitution for object identification. Example demonstration of navigation strategies used by a blindfolded participant (female) locating a chair with feedback from the visual sensory substitution system. The participant wore a LiDAR-enabled smartphone around their neck to map and classify their physical surroundings. Coloured surfaces on the smartphone indicate object classification (blue, chairs; purple, desks; grey, doors). The haptic array included a torsional unit that informed the user when they were facing a chair. The participant was given no previous information on the location of the chair before recording and they were given no other feedback apart from torsion and indentation from the haptic array."
