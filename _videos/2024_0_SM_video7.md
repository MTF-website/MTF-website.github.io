description: "Visual sensory substitution for obstacle-course navigation. Example demonstration of navigation strategies used by a blindfolded participant (male) traversing an obstacle course with feedback from the visual sensory substitution system. The participant wore a LiDAR-enabled smartphone around their neck to continuously map their physical surroundings. Apart from the haptic device, rendering smartphone-derived sensory information as patterns of indentation on the back of their neck, no other feedback was given to the participant. The participant was given no previous information on the path configured in this video before recording."
