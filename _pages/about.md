Matthew T. Flavin is a postdoctoral researcher at Northwestern University, working with Prof. John A. Rogers. He received his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering in 2021 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and he received his B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He received the NIH Ruth L. Kirschstein Institutional National Research Service Award (T32) and the Draper Laboratory Fellowship. The vision for his independent research program is to develop powerful peripheral neural interfaces and mechatronic wearables that leverage advanced sensors and intelligent systems to address important and unresolved challenges in patient care.
