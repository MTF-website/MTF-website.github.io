As suggested by the emergence of systems for virtual and augmented reality, capabilities for fast, programmable manipulation of human sensory perception have wide-ranging applications in social media, gaming, and entertainment. Particularly compelling opportunities exist in therapeutic biomedical systems that apply these somatosensory interfaces towards substituting and augmenting missing sensory capabilities. Ongoing studies aim to apply these systems to help people with sensory impairments and intractable pain.
