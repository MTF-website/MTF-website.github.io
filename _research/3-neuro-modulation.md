Developing effective means of interfacing with neural tissue is one of the major scientific challenges of our time. While haptic interfaces offer a powerful means of delivering information to afferent channels, motor activation requires a different approach. This research direction will apply ion-concentration modulation with ion-selective membranes, leveraging both the intrinsic selectivity of chemical modulation and the spatiotemporal resolution of direct electrical stimulation. These principles establish the basis for an electrochemical system that sources ions as therapeutic stock from the surrounding physiological media, regenerating them in situ, for the purposes of continuous neuromodulation.
