In recent work, we demonstrate a wearable device capable of concentrating gases at the interface of the skin. Although we think of our skin as being impermeable, in reality, it is constantly exchanging gases with the environment. This device continuously measures humidity and volatile organic compounds emerging from the skin. We demonstrate that this non-invasive, non-contact device can help detect changes in the skin that were not visible to the naked eye. In murine studies, the platform differentiated diabetic from healthy wound-healing trajectories days before visual cues appeared, demonstrating its promise for early monitoring of chronic wounds.
