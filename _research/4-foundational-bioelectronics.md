Prof. Flavin’s early work contributed to foundational projects in the area of flexible electronics and wearable bioelectronics over the last decade. This work introduced new concepts into engineering science, including the controlled buckling of 3D structures and assembly of soft compartmentalized flexible circuits, with broad biomedical implications.
