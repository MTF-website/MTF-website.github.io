We are working to expand the usage of augmentative technologies to address long-standing challenges in mathematics teaching and learning. Our augmented reality system for embodied learning bridges the gap between mathematical representations (e.g., symbols) and the everyday practices of children. Overall, this body of work informs new theory and practices for introducing intelligent systems into mathematics education.
