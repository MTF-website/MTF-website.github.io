Capabilities for fast, programmable manipulation of human sensory perception have wide-ranging applications in therapeutic biomedical systems, including somatosensory interfaces that substitute or augment missing sensory capabilities. Compared with most wearable electronic devices, haptics interfaces can benefit from wider coverage across the surface of the skin. This research direction will address significant untapped potential in these areas of research by introducing a more expansive concept of somatosensory interfaces, developing a distributed system of textile-encapsulated actuators.
