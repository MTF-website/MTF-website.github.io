Pain control and management in humans is an unresolved problem with significant medical, societal, and economical implications. Targeted drug therapies, such as opioid painkillers, are highly effective in pain controlâ€”however, repeated, long-term, systemic administration poses many long-term risks, including addiction and de-sensitization. This research direction will aim to develop non-invasive, non-addictive interventions for pain management. This will focus on targeting specific sources of pain emanating from muscle tightness in the neck and back using an intelligent system of sensors and actuators.
